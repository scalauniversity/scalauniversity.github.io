##### **Introduction to Functional Programming**

* Strategy Pattern
* Generic Strategy
* Functions as values, and Higher order functions
* Lambdas syntax
* Difference between Methods and Functions
* Recursive functions
* Currying and partial function application and positional notation
* Tail recursion
* Val, var, lazy val, pass-by-value and pass-by-name

##### **Object Oriented Programming in Scala**

* Classes, Objects, and Traits
* Case classes as Functional Objects
* Immutable objects
* Accessors
* Class extension, overriding vals, dynamic dispatch
* Name based dependency resolution
* Object hierarchy
* Exceptions, Nothing and Null types, unit
* Infix notation
* Operators as methods
* Tuples

##### **Pattern matching**

* Option / Some / None
* Extractors
* Expression problem
* Pattern forms
  * constants
  * variables
  * constructors
  * exceptions
* PartialFunction


##### **Collections and combinators**

* No syntax
* Immutable vs mutable collections
* Seq, Set, Map, Iterators
* Take, drop etc,
* Map, filter, folding, reduce
* FlatMap, Collect,
* Foreach
* Working with list: :: operator :::
* Function composition
* GroupBy,
* For comprehensions
* Options with for

##### **Implicits**

* Implicit classes: extension methods
  * Using tappers for debugging
* Implicit defs: not-recommended (dotted relationships, array and string interoperability)
* Implicit parameters: type classes
  * Reverse Ordering

##### **Misc Topics**

* Streams
* Regular expression
* Memory implications of immutable data structures
* Module system using traits
* Packages and visibility
* Java-Scala interoperability: collections
* Auxiliary constructors

##### **Discussion pain-points**

* Compile times
* Binary compatibility
* Sbt
* Mixed coding styles
* IDEs
